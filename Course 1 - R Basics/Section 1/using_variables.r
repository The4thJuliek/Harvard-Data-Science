#Using variables 1
#What is the sum of the first n positive integers?
#We can use the formula n(n+1)/2 to quickly compute this quantity.

# Here is how you compute the sum for the first 20 integers
20*(20+1)/2 

# However, we can define a variable to use the formula for other values of n
n <- 20
n*(n+1)/2

n <- 25
n*(n+1)/2

# Below, write code to calculate the sum of the first 100 integers

n <- 100
n*(n+1)/2

# Below, write code to calculate the sum of the first 1000 integers 
n <- 1000
n*(n+1)/2
